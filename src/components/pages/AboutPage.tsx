                    I'm a senior full-stack software engineer with over eight years of experience
                    building and modernizing enterprise systems across the insurance, banking,
                    and government sectors. My expertise covers a wide range of frontend,
                    backend, and cloud technologies, with a proven track record of
                    architecting data platforms and revitalizing legacy systems.

                    What has always drawn me to this field is the fundamental human drive to
                    create. For me, software development is the ultimate medium for building
                    something new and useful from the ground up. While I find deep satisfaction
                    in the craft of engineering itself, the ultimate reward is seeing the
                    solutions I build make a tangible, positive impact for the people who
                    use them.
