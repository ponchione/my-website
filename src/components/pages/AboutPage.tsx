                    I'm Mitchell, a senior full-stack engineer who loves the craft of building.
                    For over eight years, Iâ€™ve applied that passion to modernizing critical systems in the insurance,
                    banking, and government sectors, specializing in untangling legacy code and architecting new data
                    platforms.

                    While I enjoy the technical challenge, the real reward is seeing the software I build make
                    a tangible, positive impact for the people who rely on it every day.

                    First and foremost, I'm a husband and father to a growing family of (soon to be) five.
                    That role has taught me invaluable lessons in patience and long-term planning.
                    But the engineer in me still needs an outlet, which I find in building experimental projects
                    with Go, or playing grand strategy games with friends. And when I need a complete reset, I find
                    it in the focus and simplicity of rucking outdoors.
